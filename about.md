### Mission

MODES aims to promote research and education in model-driven design and the mining of software repositories. The laboratory focuses on modeling, transformation and analysis of software systems, and on techniques to mine repositories to automate and optimize software engineering tasks such as code and model generation.

A central element of the platform will be recommender systems that support decision-making in critical software engineering tasks. These systems will analyze heterogeneous data — for example, code repositories, historical change logs, or developer interactions — and provide tailored suggestions to improve workflows and outcomes. Typical use cases include suggesting appropriate design patterns, recommending reusable components, or automatically flagging potential defects based on historical bug patterns.

### Objectives

- Promote research in model-driven software design.
- Develop and integrate repository mining techniques to extract actionable insights from project history.
- Provide teaching tools and resources for undergraduate, graduate and doctoral courses on MDE and software mining.
- Support automatic completion systems for software engineering tasks (code generation, model generation, test automation).
- Publish research results, share tools and datasets, and participate in international conferences and collaborations.

### Conclusions

The virtual MODES laboratory offers the DISIM department at the University of L'Aquila an opportunity to become a reference point for research and development in MDE and software mining. The lab will provide a rich environment for experimentation and education and will promote open sharing of tools, data and models.
