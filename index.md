## MODES — Model-Driven Engineering and Software Mining Laboratory

The MODES laboratory (Model-Driven Engineering and Software Mining Laboratory) is proposed at the University of L'Aquila within one of the most active international research groups in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). The MDE group at L'Aquila has participated in several European projects (e.g., OSSMETER, TYPHON, CROSSMINER, LOWCOMOTE, LearnPad, MOSAICO) and in industrial research collaborations (for example with Rete Ferroviaria Italiana).

MODES expands the group's research toward recommender systems for software engineering, with a special focus on modeling. In particular, the lab will explore and develop advanced "model assistants" — intelligent tools that help create and manipulate models — by combining MDE techniques with software-mining and modern machine learning methods.
