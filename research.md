## Research Lines

The MODES laboratory focuses on the intersection of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and software repository mining. Main research directions include:

- Model-driven software design: modeling languages, model transformations, model analysis and tool support.
- Software repository mining: extracting knowledge from code histories, issue trackers and developer interactions.
- Recommender systems for software engineering: tools that suggest design patterns, reusable components, and implementation hints.
- Automated completion and generation: code and model synthesis, test automation, and model assistants powered by data-driven and AI techniques.

### Infrastructure and Tools

The lab is primarily virtual and relies on a software infrastructure that includes:

- UML and modeling editors (e.g., MagicDraw, Modelio)
- Access to trained models and LLMs for research on model assistants and code/model generation
- Commercial modeling systems (e.g., MetaEdit+) for advanced modeling scenarios

These resources will enable experiments combining MDE and modern machine learning approaches to produce reproducible and reusable research artifacts.
