	abstract = {Model-driven engineering has been widely applied in software development, aiming to facilitate the coordination among various stakeholders. Such a methodology allows for a more efficient and effective development process. Nevertheless, modeling is a strenuous activity that requires proper knowledge of components, attributes, and logic to reach the level of abstraction required by the application domain. In particular, metamodels play an important role in several paradigms, and specifying wrong entities or attributes in metamodels can negatively impact on the quality of the produced artifacts as well as other elements of the whole process. During the metamodeling phase, modelers can benefit from assistance to avoid mistakes, e.g., getting recommendations like metaclasses and structural features relevant to the metamodel being defined. However, suitable machinery is needed to mine data from repositories of existing modeling artifacts and compute recommendations. In this work, we propose MemoRec, a novel approach that makes use of a collaborative filtering strategy to recommend valuable entities related to the metamodel under construction. Our approach can provide suggestions related to both metaclasses and structured features that should be added in the metamodel under definition. We assess the quality of the work with respect to different metrics, i.e., success rate, precision, and recall. The results demonstrate that MemoRec is capable of suggesting relevant items given a partial metamodel and supporting modelers in their task.},

	abstract = {Modeling is a ubiquitous activity in the process of software development. In recent years, such an activity has reached a high degree of intricacy, guided by the heterogeneity of the components, data sources, and tasks. The democratized use of models has led to the necessity for suitable machinery for mining modeling repositories. Among others, the classification of metamodels into independent categories facilitates personalized searches by boosting the visibility of metamodels. Nevertheless, the manual classification of metamodels is not only a tedious but also an error-prone task. According to our observation, misclassification is the norm which leads to a reduction in reachability as well as reusability of metamodels. Handling such complexity requires suitable tooling to leverage raw data into practical knowledge that can help modelers with their daily tasks. In our previous work, we proposed AURORA as a machine learning classifier for metamodel repositories. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the system by taking into consideration different settings as well as evaluation metrics. More importantly, we improve the original AURORA tool by changing its internal design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed amendment is beneficial to the classification of metamodels. We also compared our approach with two baseline algorithms, namely gradient boosted decision tree and support vector machines. Eventually, we see that AURORA outperforms the baselines with respect to various quality metrics.},

	abstract = {To perform their daily tasks, developers intensively make use of existing resources by consulting open source software (OSS) repositories. Such platforms contain rich data sources, e.g., code snippets, documentations, and user discussions, that can be useful for supporting development activities. Over the last decades, several techniques and tools have been promoted to provide developers with innovative features, aiming to bring in improvements in terms of development effort, cost savings, and productivity. In the context of the EU H2020 CROSSMINER project, a set of recommendation systems has been conceived to assist software programmers in different phases of the development process. The systems provide developers with various artifacts, such as third-party libraries, documentation about how to use the APIs being adopted, or relevant API function calls. To develop such recommendations, various technical choices have been made to overcome issues related to several aspects including the lack of baselines, limited data availability, decisions about the performance measures, and evaluation approaches. This paper is an experience report to present the knowledge pertinent to the set of recommendation systems developed through the CROSSMINER project. We explain in detail the challenges we had to deal with, together with the related lessons learned when developing and evaluating these systems. Our aim is to provide the research community with concrete takeaway messages that are expected to be useful for those who want to develop or customize their own recommendation systems. The reported experiences can facilitate interesting discussions and research work, which in the end contribute to the advancement of recommendation systems applied to solve different issues in Software Engineering.},

	abstract = {Open source software (OSS) allows developers to study, change, and improve the code free of charge. There are several high-quality software projects which deliver stable and well-documented products. Most OSS forges typically sustain active user and expert communities which in turn provide decent levels of support both with respect to answering user questions as well as to repairing reported software bugs. Code reuse is an intrinsic feature of OSS, and developing a new system by leveraging existing open source components can reduce development effort, and thus it can be beneficial to at least two phases of the software life cycle, i.e., implementation and maintenance. However, to improve software quality, it is essential to develop a system by learning from well-defined, mature projects. In this sense, the ability to find similar projects that facilitate the undergoing development activities is of high importance. In this paper, we address the issue of mining open source software repositories to detect similar projects, which can be eventually reused by developers. We propose CrossSim as a novel approach to model the OSS ecosystem and to compute similarities among software projects. An evaluation on a dataset collected from GitHub shows that our proposed approach outperforms three well-established baselines.},

The details of using the MDE technologies and the relationships between the MDE artifacts are typically not accessible at a higher level of abstraction, which makes it hard to understand, build, and test the MDE projects and thus, to reuse the contained MDE artifacts. In this paper, we present a megamodel-based reverse engineering methodology and an infrastructure MDEprofiler for recovering details of using MDE technologies in MDE projects and modeling these details at a higher level of abstraction. We exemplify the approach for MDE projects that use ATL-based model transformations.},

In this paper we propose MUSE (Method USage Examples), an approach for mining and ranking actual code examples that show how to use a speciﬁc method. MUSE combines static slicing (to simplify examples) with clone detection (to group similar examples), and uses heuristics to select and rank the best examples in terms of reusability, understandability, and popularity. MUSE has been empirically evaluated using examples mined from six libraries, by performing three studies involving a total of 140 developers to: (i) evaluate the selection and ranking heuristics, (ii) provide their perception on the usefulness of the selected examples, and (iii) perform speciﬁc programming tasks using the MUSE examples. The results indicate that MUSE selects and ranks examples close to how humans do, most of the code examples (82\%) are perceived as useful, and they actually help when performing programming tasks.},

Making decisions about quality and adoption involves analysing code, documentation, online discussions, and issue trackers. There is too much information to process manually and it is common that uninformed decisions have to be made with detrimental effects. CROSSMINER aims to remedy this by automatically extracting the required knowledge and injecting it into the developers’ Integrated Development Environments (IDE), at the time they need it to make design decisions. This allows them to reduce their effort in knowledge acquisition and to increase the quality of their code. CROSSMINER uniquely combines advanced software project analyses with online IDE monitoring. Developers will be monitored to infer which information is timely, based on readily available knowledge stored earlier by a set of advanced offline deep analyses of related OSS projects.},
