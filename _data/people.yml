- name: "Prof. Davide Di Ruscio"
  role: "Full Professor"
  email: "davide.diruscio@example.com"
  bio: "Davide Di Ruscio is a Full Professor at the Department of Information Engineering Computer Science and Mathematics of the University of L’Aquila. His main research interests are related to several aspects of Software Engineering, Open Source Software, and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), including domain-specific modelling languages, model transformation, model differencing, coupled evolution, and recommendation systems. He has published more than 200 papers in various journals, conferences and workshops on such topics. He has been in the PC and involved in the organization of several workshops and conferences, and he is a reviewer of many journals like IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Science of Computer Programming, Software and Systems Modeling, and Journal of Systems and Software. He is a member of the steering committee of the International Conference on Model Transformation (ICMT), of the Software Language Engineering (SLE) conference, of the Seminar Series on Advanced Techniques & Tools for Software Evolution (SATTOSE), of the Workshop on Modelling in Software Engineering at ICSE (MiSE) and of the International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE). Davide is on the editorial board of the International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM), of IEEE Software, of the Journal of Object Technology, and of the IET Software journal. Since 2006, he has been working on different European and Italian research projects by contributing to the application of MDE concepts and tools in several application domains (e.g., service-based software systems, autonomous systems, open-source software systems, and hybrid polystore systems)."
