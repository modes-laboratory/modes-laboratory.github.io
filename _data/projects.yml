  title: OSSMETER
  year: 2021
  summary: "OSSMETER aims to extend the state-of-the-art in the field of automated analysis and measurement of open-source software (OSS), and develop a platform that will support decision makers in the process of discovering, comparing, assessing and monitoring the health, quality, impact and activity of open-source software. To achieve this, OSSMETER will compute trustworthy quality indicators by performing advanced analysis and integration of information from diverse sources including the project metadata, source code repositories, communication channels and bug tracking systems of OSS projects. OSSMETER does not aim at building another OSS forge but instead at providing a meta-platform for analysing existing OSS projects that are developed in existing OSS forges and foundations such as SourceForge, Google Code, GitHub, Eclipse, Mozilla and Apache."
